# Learning Log
This is a Django framework project.

The purpose of the learning log is to give the user the ability to create topics of interest.
Under each topic will be entries made by the user to add the new things that they have learned.
They will be timestamped so this will be a type of learning log journal.

It could be summarized for example as:
Topic: Python
1:53:00 What I learned about python today is...

Definitely useful. Especially for those who want to keep track of their progress in a dedicated place.
